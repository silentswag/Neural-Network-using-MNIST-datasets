# Neural-Network-using-MNIST-datasets
The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of 60,000 handwritten digit images for training and 10,000 images for testing. The digits in the dataset range from 0 to 9.
Each image in the MNIST dataset is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels. Each pixel value represents the darkness of the pixel, with higher values indicating darker shades and lower values indicating lighter shades. The images are centered and normalized, making them suitable for training machine learning models.

A sequential model is a linear stack of layers, where each layer in the model is connected to the next layer, forming a pipeline-like structure. It is called "sequential" because the data flows sequentially through each layer from input to output.

In the case of MNIST digit classification, a typical sequential model consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: This layer specifies the input shape of the data. For MNIST, the input shape is (28, 28, 1), representing the 28x28 grayscale images.

Convolutional Layers: Convolutional layers are used to extract meaningful features from the input images. They apply a set of learnable filters to the input and generate feature maps. Multiple convolutional layers can be stacked to capture hierarchical features.

Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample the feature maps generated by convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining the most important information. Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.

Flatten Layer: This layer flattens the pooled feature maps into a 1-dimensional vector, preparing the data for the fully connected layers.

Fully Connected Layers: These layers are also known as dense layers. They connect every neuron in the current layer to every neuron in the next layer. Fully connected layers are responsible for learning the class probabilities based on the extracted features.

Output Layer: The final layer of the sequential model is the output layer. For MNIST digit classification, it typically consists of 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0 to 9) and uses a softmax activation function to output the probabilities of each class.

The sequential model is compiled with a loss function (such as categorical cross-entropy), an optimizer (such as Adam or SGD), and optional evaluation metrics (such as accuracy). Once compiled, the model can be trained on the MNIST dataset using backpropagation and gradient descent techniques.

By configuring the number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, you can customize the architecture of the sequential model to experiment with different network designs for MNIST digit classification.
